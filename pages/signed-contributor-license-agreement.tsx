              <p>Thank you for your interest in contributing to the EdgeDB project ("Project") of MagicStack Inc.</p>
              <p>This Contribution License Agreement (“Agreement”) is agreed to by the party signing below (“You”),
              and conveys certain license rights to MagicsStack Inc. and its affiliates (“MagicStack”) for Your
              contributions to the Project. This Agreement is effective as of the latest signature date below.</p>
              <p><strong>1. Definitions.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>“Code”</strong> means the computer software code, whether in human-readable or machine-executable form,
              that is delivered by You to MagicStack under this Agreement.</p>
              <p><strong>“Submit”</strong> is the act of uploading, submitting, transmitting, or distributing code or other content to the
              Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
              systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of
              discussing and improving that Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
              otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Submission.”</p>
              <p><strong>“Submission”</strong> means the Code and any other copyrightable material Submitted by You, including any
              associated comments and documentation.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Your Submission.</strong> You must agree to the terms of this Agreement before making a Submission to the
              Project.  This Agreement covers any and all Submissions that You, now or in the future (except as
              described in Section 4 below), Submit to the Project.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Originality of Work.</strong> You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work.
              Should You wish to Submit materials that are not Your original work, You may Submit them separately
              to the Project if You (a) retain all copyright and license information that was in the materials as You
              received them, (b) in the description accompanying Your Submission, include the phrase “Submission
              containing materials of a third party:” followed by the names of the third party and any licenses or other
              restrictions of which You are aware, and (c) follow any other instructions in the Project’s written
              guidelines concerning Submissions.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Your Employer.</strong> References to “employer” in this Agreement include Your employer or anyone else
              for whom You are acting in making Your Submission, e.g. as a contractor, vendor, or agent. If Your
              Submission is made in the course of Your work for an employer or Your employer has intellectual
              property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable law, You must secure permission from Your
              employer to make the Submission before signing this Agreement. In that case, the term “You” in this
              Agreement will refer to You and the employer collectively. If You change employers in the future and
              desire to Submit additional Submissions for the new employer, then You agree to sign a new Agreement
              and secure permission from the new employer before Submitting those Submissions.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Licenses.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>a. Copyright License.</strong> You grant MagicStack, and those who receive the Submission directly or
              indirectly from MagicStack, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license in the
              Submission to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute
              the Submission and such derivative works, and to sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third
              parties.</p>
              <p><strong>b. Patent License.</strong> You grant MagicStack, and those who receive the Submission directly or
              indirectly from MagicStack, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license under
              Your patent claims that are necessarily infringed by the Submission or the combination of the
              Submission with the Project to which it was Submitted to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and
              import or otherwise dispose of the Submission alone or with the Project.</p>
              <p><strong>c. Other Rights Reserved.</strong> Each party reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement.
              No additional licenses or rights whatsoever (including, without limitation, any implied licenses) are
              granted by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Representations and Warranties.</strong> You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above
              licenses. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work (except as You may
              have disclosed under Section 3). You represent that You have secured permission from Your employer to
              make the Submission in cases where Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for Your
              employer or Your employer has intellectual property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable
              law. If You are signing this Agreement on behalf of Your employer, You represent and warrant that You
              have the necessary authority to bind the listed employer to the obligations contained in this Agreement.
              You are not expected to provide support for Your Submission, unless You choose to do so. UNLESS
              REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, AND EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES
              EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTIONS 3, 4, AND 6, THE SUBMISSION PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS
              PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF
              NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
              <p><strong>7. Notice to MagicStack.</strong> You agree to notify MagicStack in writing of any facts or circumstances of which
              You later become aware that would make Your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any
              respect.</p>
              <p><strong>8. Information about Submissions.</strong> You agree that contributions to Projects and information about
              contributions may be maintained indefinitely and disclosed publicly, including Your name and other
              information that You submit with Your Submission.</p>
              <p><strong>9. Governing Law/Jurisdiction.</strong> This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario.
              The parties waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens.</p>
              <p><strong>10. Entire Agreement/Assignment.</strong> This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties, and
              supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings or communications, written or oral, between
              the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be assigned by MagicStack.</p>
